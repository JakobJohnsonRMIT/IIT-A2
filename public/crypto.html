      <h4 class="heading-4">What does it do?</h4>
      <p class="tech-content">
        Blockchain technology is what makes cryptocurrency possible – it is a form of distributed ledger technology (DLT) which utilises a decentralised network of computers to create ‘blocks’, sections of transaction history showing the flow of cryptocurrency from one account to another. [1] 
        <br>
        <br>
        The most widely known example of blockchain is Bitcoin/BTC, which simply stores chronological transaction data and ensures validity of this data through its proof of work consensus mechanism[2][3][4]; data from the block is input into the SHA-256 algorithm and ‘hashed’, computers around the world ‘mine’ Bitcoin by performing math equations which find the correct number matching the hash and upon submitting their hash to the blockchain they are rewarded with newly generated bitcoins. [4][6] 
        <br>
        <br>
        While Bitcoin may be the most widely known cryptocurrency and blockchain, there are many other cryptocurrencies which utilise different ledger technologies and consensus mechanisms. 
        <br>
        <br>
        DLTs include blockchain, hashgraph, DAG, holochain and Tempo (radix) while consensus mechanisms include proof of work, proof of stake, proof of capacity, proof of activity, proof of burn and proof of history. [1] 
        <br>
        <br>
        We have come a long way from the creation of Bitcoin in 2009, and in 2022 our modern cryptocurrencies can do a lot more than just store transaction data; Ethereum is the second largest cryptocurrency by market cap [7] and was the first to support smart contracts and subsequently, decentralized apps (dApps). [9] 
        <br>
        <br>
        Smart contracts are pieces of code which are written into a particular blockchain and executed when certain parameters are met [8]; on Ethereum this code is executed by the ‘Ethereum virtual machine’. In practice, the sum computing power of all nodes mining the Ethereum blockchain is combined into one great computer capable of running thousands of applications with no centralised server; the applications storage is done on the blockchain whilst the app logic is performed on the EVM. [10] 
        <br>
        <br>
        There are many advantages to dApps including anonymity, freedom from censorship, security, stability and longevity; this is great news for users around the world as we transition from centralised web 2.0 companies such as Google, Facebook, twitter etc. to decentralised web 3.0 services running on Ethereum, Avalanche, Fantom etc. [9] 
        <br>
        <br>
        Currently, there are millions of active dApp users who mainly play games, utilise decentralised finance platforms, trade on marketplaces and swap on exchanges[10]; this means that of those millions of users, their login to the dApp is anonymous, their payment system is built in to the cryptocurrency network, they never have to suffer downtime due to a server issue, they can never be banned or censored and they can always use the service no matter if the developers have long abandoned its development.[9] 
        <br>
        <br>
        There are thousands of cryptocurrencies on the market, and while some provide no actual benefit to humanity (meme coins), there are others with real world use cases which are being used right now to solve various problems. 
        <br>
        <br>
        XRP (Ripple) is the leading cryptocurrency for use in the global banking system, it’s blockchain is incredibly fast with settled transactions in less than five seconds, fees are incredibly low with standard transactions costing only 29 cents, and its powerful scalability means that the network can always keep up with the demand of its customers. As the main use case for XRP is in global banking, the cryptocurrency aims to reduce the cost of sourcing liquidity and maintaining stability when sending large amounts of money from country to country; often this process is slow and involves complex banking systems where multiple currencies are exchanged for each other, banks often wait weeks for payments to settle and must pay thousands of dollars in fees as the traditional processes take place. [12][13] 
      </p>
      <h4 class="heading-4">
        A likely impact of cryptocurrency is the transition from a global fiat system to a hybrid fiat/crypto system.
      </h4>
      <p class="tech-content">
        Governments borrow fiat currency from a central bank in exchange for the repayment of the principal amount plus interest [15], this currency is not backed by any asset, the gold standard was abandoned by Australia in 1932 [17] and by the United States of America in 1971 [16] and in 2021 there are virtually zero currencies truly backed 1:1 by gold or any other store of value assets. Additionally, fiat currency is highly inflationary in nature as governments continue to borrow more from the central banks, the money is printed out of thin air, diluting the buying power of each existing dollar and in the past two years more than 40% of US dollars in existence were newly printed. [14] 
        <br>
        <br>
        It should now be quite clear that a cryptocurrency capable of executing smart contracts is a much better representation of value than a US dollar; where a US dollar is simply a piece of paper, a technologically advanced cryptocurrency such as AVAX, HBAR or ADA provides value to its users through the tangible effects of its network. 
        <br>
        <br>
        With that said, there are significant barriers to overcome if cryptocurrencies will replace the dollar; there is a huge team of key players in the public and private sectors who back the dollar and enjoy the control they hold [18]– digital fiat payments are fundamentally traceable and easily taxable, the supply of dollars is controlled by the government and the banks have a monopoly on access to newly printed money. If cryptocurrency adoption does overtake fiat, then the crypto space has everything to gain whilst the fiat space has everything to lose, therefore I believe governments and banks will try their hardest to create a hybrid system.  
        <br>
        <br>
        To achieve this, banks and governments must upgrade their traditional financial systems to distributed ledgers and issue state cryptocurrency, as the demand for fiat infrastructure decreases, the technologies supporting fiat currency and payments will be phased out. As the utilisation of cash decreases ATMs, coin counters, bank tellers, vaults and all their associated logistics and personnel will become obsolete. 
      </p>
      <h4 class="heading-4">How will this affect you?</h4>
      <p class="tech-content">
        In daily life, paying for goods and services could be very different to our current system. Australia could adopt a stable coin such as TrueAUD (TAUD) or issue a government run cryptocurrency eg. AUDC.  I could choose to hold my coins in a wallet at a major retail bank such as NAB, a decentralised wallet such as MetaMask or a physical keystore such as Ledger, I could pay at physical stores with a QR code, NFC or USB and online with a built-in crypto payment system. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Certain vendors may accept only the nation’s currency, a particular set of cryptocurrencies or both, so the customer may either hold different currencies or swap for the right currency at the time of transaction. In practice, when shopping both in person or online, I might hold HBAR and pay for goods by automatically swapping HBAR for TAUD at the time of purchase, or by manually swapping my HBAR at a decentralised exchange beforehand. When overseas there would be no need to apply for a travelling card of exchange cash of different nation states, I could simply exchange my TAUD for USDT and pay for goods and services the same way I would have at home. 
        <br>
        <br>
        When borrowing money to pay for a car I could take out a traditional loan at a major retail bank, or instead, I could borrow at an interest rate as low as 1% with a collateralised crypto loan at a decentralised finance dAPP. For example, if I wanted to buy a new car for $70,000 TAUD I could borrow at a rate as high as 15% with a deposit of 20% and pay back the loan over 5 years, or I could use my 1200 AVAX as collateral to take out a 50% loan to value ratio loan with only 1% interest per annum, I would receive the loan as MIM, trade them for TAUD and buy the car. I could apply for the loan anonymously without the need for a credit check, and if I wanted to change the structure of the loan I could at any time. [19]
