      <p class="interview-content">
        Currently due to the pandemic Taylor has been working from home. She spends most of her time in teams meetings.
      </p>
      <h4 class="heading-4">What aspect of their position is most challenging?</h4>
      <p class="interview-content">
        Working from home has made working in teams difficult as you can’t just walk to someone’s desk and speak with them which causes the interactions over Microsoft teams need to have an agenda and a structure, so the messages aren’t lost in unorganised discussions.
