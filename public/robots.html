      <h2 class="heading">Robots</h2>
      <h4 class="heading-4">What does it do?</h4>
      <p class="tech-content">
        Robotics is the combination of engineering and computer technology to create machines designed to assist and improve human activity [1]. Robotics can be used to replace humans or assist them with daily tasks, for example, in medical advancements it allows for limbs to be replaced to allow for regular use of bodily functions [3].  An example of this is robotic legs used in place of prosthetic legs to give the handicapped individual the ability to walk normally [3].  
        <br>
        <br>
        Robotics has also been applied to military operation, with the Marine Corps in the USA as one example of adopting this technology [2]. The Marine Corps have seen the benefits of utilising robotic technology to preserve human life by removing individuals from dangerous tasks such as mine-sweeping and bomb defusal, thus reducing life-threatening risks on the Marines [2].  
        <br>
        <br>
        The robotics used in these scenarios are some examples of how robotics can be a positive replacement for human labour, however, they are not the only form of robotics used by the military [2]. The use of unmanned ground vehicles is used to perform reconnaissance, scouting missions, and used as a weapon when fitted with remote controlled turrets [2]. They have also adopted robotics through a firefighting robot designed by researchers at Virginia Tech called the ‘SAFFiR’ [2]. This is a robot that is designed to extinguish fires on naval ships and removes the risk of humans being to close to high-risk fires out of sea [2]. It is noted that these robots are also used to assist rather than replace so that the most dangerous parts are done by ‘SAFFiR’ rather than the personnel [2].  
        <br> 
        <br>
        Robotics traditionally requires the user inputs to operate [1]. However, the use of autonomous robotics has recently advanced and within the next 3 years is likely to become a reality due to the advancement of computer science which has evolved to allow robotics to operate safely through autonomous behavior [1].  The aim amongst companies that produce these technologies is that eventually robots will be able to replicate human behavior and perform as humans do [1]. Although the technology is not there yet, with companies such as Hanson Robotics [8] that are coming closer and closer to reaching this goal.  
        <br>
        <br>
        Robotics has also assisted in the advancement of bio-medical devices with focus in areas such as repairing and enabling motor skills, surgical assistance and assistance in the delivery of therapy and other medical operations [3]. The use of the robotics to repair and enable motor skills is commonly used for those that have nerve damage and are designed to assist in regaining the function of the lost motor skills [3]. This is often the loss of the use of limbs so the robotics designed can be either replacement limbs or assistance. There is also the use of robotics designed for the use in hospitals for the delivery of radiation therapy through targeted beams [3]. The benefit of this is the precision that it allows to target tumours and the angles it can obtain without disruption of the patient.  
      </p>
      <h4 class="heading-4">What technological or other developments make this possible?</h4>
      <p class="tech-content">
        At the current state of robotics and the evolving technology that surrounds it, the uses of this technology have been advancing all fields it touches. The latest advancements for robotics by those in the mechatronics field and computer science have been the artificial intelligence inclusion with robotics, mechanical and adaptions in the individual and societal uses. The state-of-the-art robotics is currently on display amongst companies such as Boston Dynamics. An example of this is how they display with their case studies what the capability for robotics currently is, such as the “Spot” with its variations “Spot Arm” [5] and “Spot Scout” [6]. An example of these robotics being put to practical use is the “Spot Inspection Solution” being used in caves and mines such as the Kidd Creek Mine [7]. With the use of these robotics, it allows the inspection and studies of the mine to be safely performed rather than putting the workers in harms way.  
      </p>
      <h4 class="heading-4">What is the likely impact?</h4>
      <p class="tech-content">
        Currently we are seeing the use of robotics become more prominent in the workplace due to the advantages they provide the business owners. Some of these advantages are the work that is being done by the robotics that replaces humans in dangerous situations and reduces the physical strain by the workforce. The heavy lifting done by robotics [4] rather than employees frees up the labour time spent on these tasks which in turn saves money on labour costs as the employee can perform other tasks.   
        <br>
        <br>
        Robotics are making leaps and bounds forward to becoming the norm in the workplace. In fields such as Bio-med [3], military [2] and industrial [4], it is displayed that in the coming years robotics will replace and assist the labour force to improve the efficiency and effectiveness in the workplace.
        <br>  
        <br>
        In the coming years it is expected that the robotics field will be advancing into more societal roles and becoming a regular occurrence in the workplace. Depending on the subfields of robotics, there are advancements coming from the expansion and competitiveness of the fields. Right now, in the workplace robotics has replaced the use of the labour force for repetitive tasks and heavy lifting [4]. There is auto-sorting robotics used in warehouses [4] currently that has replaced the requirement for a human to fulfill that role, however the introduction of more robotics also requires the hiring of mechanics to keep the robotics running.  
        <br>
        <br>
        The people that are affected the most by these implementations will be the workforces that are involved in the tasks that the robots will be replacing and assisting. The changes that will occur from this implementation may be the lack of jobs available without specialised skillsets. This may cause the requirement for tertiary education to become a necessity in a lot of workplaces. Unfortunately, that is not always a possibility for some, which may have a negative impact on them and have them left behind. The larger adoption of robotics across the board, however, will also have many positive changes to society. Examples of these are the safety improvements and health benefits that robotics have on those that use it, predominantly in military and industrial scenarios along with the improvement of medical adoptions.  
        <br>
        <br>
        The adoption will also create jobs for those to maintain and quality control as well as the creation of the robotics. It also increases the demand for the skillset to operate the robotics as they are not commonly autonomous and will most likely not be a common practice to have autonomous robotics fulfilling roles in the next 3 years. However, with the increasing introduction of robotics many repetitive jobs and dangerous tasks could leave workers without a job, especially if they are unable to adapt and acquire the skillset to operate their replacement technology.  
      </p>
      <h4 class="heading-4">How will this affect you?</h4>
      <p class="tech-content">
        Personally, this can cause a personal impact on me in regards to the competitiveness of the industry. Many workers will be looking at the I.T industry and pursuing careers. In my daily life robotics can improve the work that I currently do in the logistics industry and may increase the output of motorbike parts for my industry, which allows the repair work to be completed faster rather than long wait times in the factory. It also assists in the moving of heavier objects such as the motorbikes and the production of such vehicles. The impact that the improvement of these area’s would have on me would make the acquisition of mechanical parts easier and upgrade the industry standard overall. The impact this will have on my family and friends will also be in the workplace with the improvements of their daily tasks and potential medical requirements. 
        <br>
        <br>
        I also have friends in the military that are seeing the adoption currently and will see it more in the future where the use of robotics provides great assistances in the deployment of tactics and reconnaissance overseas. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Overall, I personally view the use of robotic technology and the fields that it has touched so far to be an overwhelming positive advancement for the technology and the impact it is set to have on the future.
