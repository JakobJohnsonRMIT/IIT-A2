      <h4 class="heading-4">What does it do?</h4>
      <p class="tech-content">
        An autonomous vehicle is as the name implies a vehicle that can literally drive itself, there is no need for a driver. Autonomous and self-driving are terms that are often used interchangeably, autonomous implies that the vehicle does not require any human intervention. While a self-driving car still requires that a human passenger be in the vehicle to monitor any out of the ordinary occurrences.
        <br> 
        <br>
        There is also debate around automated vehicles versus autonomous vehicles. Olinga (2022, para.3)1’"Autonomous car means you get in in the car and the car does everything. We don't have it yet." The general difference between automated and autonomous is the level of human intervention. A vehicle that is truly autonomous would be able to determine the route, destination and be able to control the vehicle between the lanes. An automated vehicle would need directions as to the route and destination.
        <br>
        <br>
        Autonomous cars rely heavily on sensors, actuators, complex algorithms, and machine learning to achieve true autonomy. The vehicle has different sensors positioned around the vehicle. These sensors monitor the position of other vehicles on the road. While cameras look out for pedestrians, traffic lights as well as road signs. Sensors that detect light and range (lidar) bounce pulses of light off the surroundings to measure distance, detect road edges and identify road markings. There are also sensors in the wheels that detect where the curbs is for ease of parking.
        <br>
        <br>
        Complex software then processes this mass of data to plot a path and send instructions to the car’s actuators. These actuators control acceleration, braking and steering. Predictive modelling as well as object recognition help the software to follow traffic rules and navigate any obstacles on the road. There is a lo that goes into getting a vehicle to be truly autonomous. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Fully autonomous cars are still a long way off from being available to the public, several car companies are undergoing vehicle testing now. The barriers to furthering this field are not just technological, here in Australia these vehicles are still illegal to be on the road. There are other issues to consider such as weather, what happens when the weather is so bad that you can’t see the road. What happens if there is a accident? Who is responsible? The other major factor limiting this technology is cost. The use of lidar and the software required to run an automated vehicle is very expensive.
        <br>
        <br>
        As the promise of technology remains unfulfilled car companies are making moves to developing the technology for the consumer market. Tesla is charging $10,000 for its Autopilot driver-assistance feature, with plans to increase this cost. This feature is not viable now but there is a promise that this feature will be available in the future. Car companies are also developing and selling technology that will allow a driver to, as suggested by Olinga (2022)1“ hands free driving system that will allow users to keep their hands off the wheel in 95% of all traffic situations.

        Conversely in the mining sector automation has been in use for some time. Automation in this sector has been taking place across all parts of this sector, not just operational but technical as well.This use of automation will only increase as technology develops.Within the mining industry the use automation will save time, money and decrease any safety risks associated with this profession.
      </p>
      <h4 class="heading-4">What is the likely impact?</h4>
      <p class="tech-content">
        Automation has an impact on all industries from car companies,mining,and associated industries.Car companies selling technology to be used autonomously in vehicles could lead to an increase in road deaths, especially as more drivers take advantage of such extras as hands free options.The Mining industry has pivoted from a more traditional approach to one of automation, leading to an increase in safety, saving money and increases in production.The very nature of automation means that processes become efficient, this leads to a follow-on effect through the supply chain.
        <br>
        <br>
        Here in Australia, there would need to be a large amount of work conducted around changing the current legislation to enable autonomous vehicles to be on our roads. This would not only need to happen on a state basis but also at a federal level.Substantial work would also need to be done on our roads as the condition of the road are not in the best condition.
      </p>
      <h4 class="heading-4">How will this affect you?</h4>
      <p class="tech-content">
        While most of my family would embrace autonomous vehicles, my elderly in laws would struggle to use this technology as well as be able to afford, not just the actual vehicle but the maintenance associated with this technology as they are on a pension. They on the whole struggle with modern technologies.
        <br>
        <br>
        The use of autonomous technology in my everyday life would mean that the cost of purchasing a new vehicle would increase. This could put my family in a potentially bad financial position. The technology itself would be interesting to use, I would find myself feeling uncomfortable with sitting in a car and not having confidence that I would be safe.
        <br>
        <br>
        The idea of automation is incredibly positive especially in industries such as mining. Where employees are dealing with exceptionally large and diverse types of machinery. Employers can be confident that the people who work for them are safe. There is a benefit for them in the long term with the mining operating efficiently and saving money.This positivity will flow on especially as employees make use of automation in their workplace. 
        <br>
        <br>
        I think that there would need to be a shift from the perception of what an automated vehicle is to what it could be. Now there is a feeling a fear, what would happen if there was an accident? Is there enough confidence in the technology that a vehicle would not have the potential of being ‘hacked’? 
        <br>
        <br>
        I think there would need to bean exceptionally large public campaign around the use of automation and safety.
