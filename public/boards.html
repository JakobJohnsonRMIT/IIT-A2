      <h4 class="heading-4">What is a development board?</h4>
      <p class="tech-content">
        A microprocessor development board is a printed circuit board the size of a credit card containing a microprocessor and the minimal support logic needed for an electronic engineer or any person who wants to become acquainted with the microprocessor on the board and learn to program it.  
        <br>
        <br>
        Unlike a general-purpose system such as a desktop computer, usually, a development board contains no hardware dedicated to a user interface. It will have some provision to accept and run a user-supplied program, such as downloading a program through a serial port to flash memory or some form of programmable memory in a socket in earlier systems. 
      </p>
      <h4 class="heading-4">Main types of development boards:</h4>
      <h4 class="heading-4">What is a Raspberry Pi?</h4>
      <p class="tech-content">
        A Raspberry Pi is a general-purpose computer, usually with a Linux operating system and the ability to run multiple programs. It is more complicated to use than an Arduino. 
        <br>
        <br>
        A Raspberry Pi is best used when you need a full-fledged computer: driving a complicated robot, performing multiple tasks, doing intense calculations (as for Bitcoin or encryption), or creating a server and networking. 
        <br>
        <br>
        The latest Raspberry Pi 4 Model B has a Broadcom BCM2711, Quad-core Cortex-A72 (ARM v8) 64-bit SoC @ 1.5GHz, up to 8GB LPDDR4-3200 SDRAM, Gigabit Ethernet, USB 3.0, WIFI, Bluetooth, 40 GPIO pins, and can run dual monitors. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Raspberry Pi’s are ideal for portable computers, I.e., a portable kali Linux machine with a wireless network adapter could be used for an ethical hacking lab for security assessments by infosec professionals. 
      </p>

      <h4 class="heading-4">What is an Arduino?</h4>
      <p class="tech-content">
        An Arduino is a microcontroller motherboard. A microcontroller is a simple computer that can run one program at a time repeatedly. It is straightforward to use. 
        <br>
        <br>
        An Arduino board is best used for simple repetitive tasks: opening and closing a garage door, reading the outside temperature and reporting it to Twitter, driving a simple robot or motor. 
        <br>
        <br>
        The Arduino Uno is the most popular Arduino board with a 16MHz ATMEGA4809 processor and 14 GPIO pins. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Arduino is an open-source project and offers a free development IDE and an easy to learn programming language based on C. 
      </p>
      <h4 class="heading-4">What is an STM32 board?</h4>
      <p class="tech-content">
        The STM32 family of 32-bit microcontrollers based on the Arm ® Cortex ®-M processor is designed to offer new degrees of freedom to MCU users. It offers products combining very high performance, real-time capabilities, digital signal processing, low-power / low-voltage operation, and connectivity while maintaining full integration and ease of development.
        <br>
        <br>
        STM32 ARM microcontrollers are used in various applications, from simple printers to complex circuit boards in vehicles. As a result, the technical know-how of developing firmware and embedded systems using STM32 microcontrollers are an essential skill set for an engineer in electronics and communications. 
        <br>
        <br>
        STMicroelectronics the creator of the STM32 family of boards also provide free software tools such as an IDE and the board’s come with their ST-Link programmer and debugger built in. 
      </p>
      <h4 class="heading-4">What is the state of the art of this new technology?</h4>
      <p class="tech-content">
        The Raspberry Pi was first introduced in 2012, but even earlier, the Arduino and STM32 F1-series were released in 2007. 
        <br>
        <br>
        The primary use for these boards is for learning low-level computing concepts.  
      </p>
      <h4 class="heading-4">What can be done now?</h4>
      <p class="tech-content">
        Arduino’s can be used for all sorts of applications, whether you are learning electronics, embedded programming, prototyping as a hobbyist or building your solutions to everyday problems.
        <br> 
        <br>
        Raspberry Pi’s are a cheap yet powerful alternative to a desktop computer, also the ideal first computer for a child. Currently, 21 schools across England and Scotland use Raspberry Pi’s to teach computing to primary and secondary schools. 
      </p>
      <h4 class="heading-4">What can be done in the future?</h4>
      <p class="tech-content">
        In 1965, Gordon E. Moore, the co-founder of Intel, made this observation known as Moore's Law. Moore's Law states that the number of transistors on a microchip doubles about every two years, though the cost of computers is halved. Another tenet of Moore's Law says that the growth of microprocessors is exponential. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Considering Moore’s law and the trend of the IT industry, the possible improvements to MCU’s may include: 
      </p>
      <ul class="tech-list">
        <li class="tech-item">
          - Raspberry Pi’s becoming a tool for every student to plug into a monitor at school or home.
        </li>
        <li class="tech-item">
          - Every primary school could teach a robotics course using Arduino and Raspberry Pi’s.
        </li>
        <li class="tech-item">
          - The acceleration in the development of portable and connected devices, like IoT.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <h4 class="heading-4">What is the likely impact of this technology?</h4>
      <p class="tech-content">
        The impacts of this technology will be seen in the next generation, where every student will have experience with computer science and engineering fundamentals. We already see an emphasis on STEM subjects in education. 
        <br>
        <br>
        The low price of development boards and free development tools makes them easily accessible. The wealth of knowledge in documentation and community resources from start-up guides to complete projects with hardware and programming requirements so you can pick it up and start learning. 
        <br>
        <br>
        For the same reasons, there is likely to be a positive impact on the research and development industry increasing their ability to make cheap prototypes with the numerous development boards available.  
      </p>
      <h4 class="heading-4">WHow will this technology affect you?</h4>
      <p class="tech-content">
        MCU’s had positively affected me when I first discovered the Arduino Uno, from the first project of blinking an LED in the Arduino language to designing and building my projects in C.  
        <br>
        <br>
        Learning with Raspberry Pi’s has taught me the Python programming language, the Linux OS and commands, cyber security, and networking.  
        <br>
        <br>
        MCU’s allowed me to find a passion and explore that passion freely and cheaply.
